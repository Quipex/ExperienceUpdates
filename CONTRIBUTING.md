0. Fork the project if you don't have the access to it.
1. Checkout the 'develop' branch as it contains the latest unreleased changes that will be featured in the next release.
2. Checkout a new branch from the 'develop' and call it in a meaninful way. 
  For example, if you want to add a new feature that adds new text effect the desired name would be 'feature/fancy-text-variation'.
